# 🐾 Pet Disease Detection System (Final Year Project)

An AI-based web application for detecting diseases in cats and dogs using Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This system allows users to:

- Upload a pet image
- Automatically detect whether the animal is a **Cat or Dog**
- Predict possible disease category
- View prediction confidence score
- Get basic health advice
- Find nearby veterinary clinics (Map integrated)

This project was developed as a Final Year Project (FYP).

## 🧠 AI Models Used

The system uses three trained deep learning models:

1️⃣ Animal Classification Model (Cat / Dog)  
2️⃣ Dog Disease Classification Model  
3️⃣ Cat Disease Classification Model  

Framework: **TensorFlow + Keras**
